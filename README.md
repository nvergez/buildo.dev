### Buildo.dev

- [Mainnet - www.buildo.dev](https://www.buildo.dev)
- [Devnet - www.devnet.buildo.dev](https://www.devnet.buildo.dev)

(**Please be careful on the Mainnet! First, test and understand everything on the Devnet.**)

The buildo.dev app is a port of the [CLI](https://github.com/xdevguild/buildo-begins) functionality. So you can use both. In time, the functionality will probably differ a bit. Web app will have more possibilities.

The app is built using two core tools which you can also use:
- [useElven](https://www.useElven.com) - React.js hooks for interaction with the MultiversX blockchain
- [Next.js Dapp Template](https://github.com/xdevguild/nextjs-dapp-template) - The ready-to-use Next.js app template built with Tailwind and Next.js App Router architecture

The app will help to improve these tools. While building, I found a couple of bugs and created to-do items for future improvements, mainly in useElven.

### What's included

- The app can issue and manage many different token types within the MultiversX blockchain ecosystem
- The app can also help with general blockchain interactions
- It has a couple of helpful utilities and will get more.

You'll find the list of functionalities on the homepage.
